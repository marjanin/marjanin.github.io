        <p align="left"> 
        Robots will become ubiquitously useful only when they require just a few attempts to teach themselves to perform different tasks, even with complex bodies and in dynamic environments. Vertebrates use sparse trial and error to learn multiple tasks, despite their intricate tendon-driven anatomies, which are particularly hard to control because they are simultaneously nonlinear, under-determined and over-determined. However, these complex body structures provides them with versatility, agility, efficiency, and adaptability levels way above the current robotic standards. Getting inspired form biological systems, I work on developing few-shot, minimal prior-kowledge and sensory data systems to develop the next generation of bio-inspired robots that feel and act more similar to biological systems. Below is a select list of relevant publication on this project:<br /><br />

<!--         <h1 style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;text-align:left">Studying Biological Systems:</h1>
        <p align="left">This section of my research focuses on improving upon our understanding about biological systems (both the nervious system, or controller in the engineering language, and the mechanics, or the plant). Marjaninejad et. al. 2017 "Finger movements are mainly represented by a linear transformation of energy in band-specific ECoG signals" can serve as a good example where we shed some light on how our brain works. Marjaninejad & Valero-Cuevas 2019 is also a good example to show how important it is to understand tendon-driven mechanics in order to achieve the enviable levels of agility and versatality in vertebrates as well as to be able to control as efficiently.<br /><p/> -->

        <h2 style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:17px;text-align:left">Decoding brain signals (Brain-Computer Interfaces)</h3>
        <p align="left">In Marjaninejad et. al. 2023, we have introduced a Maximum Likelihood estimator with Poisson assumption based decoding pipeline for the spiking neural activity recorded from a Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC) of a human participant. We have shown it increases decoding performance compared to the state of the art used for a classification task that was to predict the imagined hand gestures.<br /><br />

        <br />
        In Marjaninejad et. al. 2017, by comparing and contrasting of performance of a linear and non-linear (Artificial Neural Networks) regressor on the different power bands driven features of Electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings collected from human participants, we have (i) succesfully predicted the actual finger movements of the participants and (ii) shown that the the population-level neural activity would loose most of its non-linear dynamics (at least on the examined power-band driven features).

        <h2 style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:17px;text-align:left">Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement for Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings</h3>
        <p align="left">In Marjaninejad et. al. 2014 (i), we have used Ensemble Empercial Mode Decomposition to enhanse SNR of ECG recordings to help with the precision of cilinical assesments. EMD is is an adaptive time-space analysis method suitable for processing series that are non-stationary and non-linear. It does so by decomposing signal into its main Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). In Ensemble EMD, we further introduce and average the select IMFs of the same or similar signals that are contaminated with white noise to get a better estimation of the original signal.<br /><br />- Online signal to noise ratio improvement of ECG signal based on EEMD of synchronized ECG beats <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7043904">(link)</a><br /><br /><p/>
