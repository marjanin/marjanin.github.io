== About

{{<img src="pelican.jpg" width=250 align="right" style="padding:10px;"/> }}



I'm a graduate student at UC Berkeley in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. I work with my research advisor, [http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tomlin/ Professor Claire Tomlin], in the [http://hybrid.eecs.berkeley.edu Hybrid Systems Lab]. My research interests include robotics, control, perception, motion planning, and artificial intelligence. Most of my research work involves the use of the [http://hybrid.eecs.berkeley.edu/starmac/ Stanford/Berkeley Testbed of Autonomous Rotorcraft for Multi-Agent Control (STARMAC)], a set of quadrotor helicopters and associated hardware and software.

Between receiving my undergraduate degree and returning to school to pursue an advanced degree, I worked in the aerospace industry. Specifically, I worked in the Controls, Operations & Analysis department of [http://sm.mdacorporation.com/ MDA Space Missions], on the Mobile Servicing System (MSS), which is a system on the International Space Station (ISS) comprised of elements including the Canadarm2 and Dextre robotic manipulators. My work included conducting analyses to ensure that planned space station assembly operations using Canadarm2 would be safe and successful, providing real-time engineering support during Space Shuttle missions to the ISS, and training astronauts and flight controllers on the systems of the MSS.
